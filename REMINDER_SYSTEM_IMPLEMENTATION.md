## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema
The reminder system uses the existing `Reminder` table with the following key fields:
- `id`, `title`, `description`
- `reminderDate`, `reminderTime`
- `type` (task_reminder, appointment_reminder, deadline, follow_up, custom)
- `isActive`, `isRecurring`, `recurringPattern`
- `user` relationship
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

### GraphQL Operations
Complete CRUD operations are available:
- `GET_REMINDERS_BY_USER` - Fetch user's reminders
- `GET_ACTIVE_REMINDERS` - Fetch active reminders
- `CREATE_REMINDER` - Create new reminder
- `UPDATE_REMINDER` - Update existing reminder
- `DELETE_REMINDER` - Delete reminder

### CRON Job Configuration
- **Process Reminders**: Runs every 5 minutes (`cron(0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * ? *)`)
- **Check Student Activity**: Runs daily at 11:59 PM (`cron(59 23 * * ? *)`)

### CRON Job Setup
To deploy the reminder processing CRON job:

```bash
cd 8base
8base deploy
```

Verify the task is scheduled in your 8base Console:
- Go to **Functions** → **Tasks**
- Look for `processReminders` task
- Verify it shows schedule: `cron(0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * ? *)`

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create a reminder with a future date/time
2. Verify it appears in the upcoming reminders list
3. Wait for the reminder time to pass
4. Check that notifications are sent
5. Test recurring reminders by setting a past date

### CRON Job Testing
```bash
